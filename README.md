# Simple Shell

This project is the most important of the first trimester of Holberton School, is the consolidation of everything we learned in the quarter about System engineering & DevOps and Low-level programming & Algorithm. Using C programming language, we develop our own Shell.

### Description

The shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

## Requirements

### General

-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using  `gcc`, using the options  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
-   Your code should use the  `Betty`  style. It will be checked using  [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl")  and  [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-   Your shell should not have any memory leaks
-   No more than 5 functions per file
-   All your header files should be include guarded
-   Use system calls only when you need to ([why?](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rp53OodD6JzhS5Cv4DHkxQ "why?"))

### GitHub

**There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.**

## More Info

### Output

-   Unless specified otherwise, your program  **must have the exact same output**  as  `sh`  (`/bin/sh`) as well as the exact same error output.
-   The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your  `argv[0]`
